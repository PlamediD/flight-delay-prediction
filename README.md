# ✈️ Flight Delay Analysis (BTS Data – January 2025)

## 📌 Overview

This project analyzes U.S. flight delay data to uncover patterns, identify key causes of delays, and highlight high-risk airports and time periods.

The goal is to move beyond simple reporting and provide **actionable insights** into airline operations and delay drivers.

---

## 📊 Dataset

* Source: Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)
* Timeframe: January 2025
* Records include airline, origin/destination, delay indicators, and delay causes

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

---

## 🔍 Key Analyses

The project explores:

* Overall delay rate across all flights
* Delay rate by airline
* Delay patterns by day of the week
* Root cause analysis of delays
* Top 10 worst airports by delay rate

---

## 📈 Key Insights

### 1. Carrier Delays Dominate

Contrary to expectations, **airline-related (carrier) delays** were the largest contributor to total delays.

This suggests that delays are often driven by:

* Operational inefficiencies
* Aircraft scheduling dependencies
* Cascading delays from earlier flights

---

### 2. Delays Are Systemic, Not Isolated

Delays often propagate throughout the day due to aircraft reuse across multiple routes.

> A single late flight can impact multiple downstream flights.

---

### 3. Day-of-Week Patterns Exist

Certain days consistently show higher delay rates, indicating potential scheduling or demand-related pressure points.

---

### 4. High-Risk Airports Identified

The analysis highlights the **top 10 airports with the highest delay rates**, which may reflect:

* Traffic congestion
* Operational complexity
* Network bottlenecks
